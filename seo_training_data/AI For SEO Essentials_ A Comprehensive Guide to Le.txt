It explains important algorithms and techniques, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Transformer Models, and Deep Convolutional Networks (DCNs).
Additionally, practical applications in art, medicine, marketing, games, and natural language processing are discussed. The chapter concludes by addressing the challenges and future of generative AI, touching on ethics, copyright issues, and its potential to revolutionize various industries.
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content based on provided data and patterns. Unlike traditional AI, which primarily analyzes and processes data, generative AI can produce something entirely new from the given information.
Here are some key aspects of generative AI:
Content Creation: Generative AI can create text, images, music, and other forms of art. For example, language models like GPT-4 can write articles, compose poetry, or engage in conversations.
Learning from Data: Generative AI is trained on vast datasets, enabling it to recognize patterns and structures
within the data. This allows it to generate new, similar content.
Practical Applications: Generative AI is used in various fields such as marketing content creation, automatic code generation, graphic design, music composition, and even in medicine, where it can assist in developing new drugs.
Generative AI is capable of a wide range of creative tasks across different mediums. For text creation, tools like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Claude Sonet excel at writing articles, stories, or poems, showcasing their versatility in language processing. In the realm of image creation, technologies such as DALL-E, MidJourney, StableDiffusion, and Leonardo are transforming how pictures and graphics are produced, allowing for unprecedented levels of artistic expression. Music creation is another area where AI shines, with platforms like Suno, Udio, MusicGen, Stable Audio, MusicLM, and Riffusion enabling the composition of music tracks that cater to varied tastes and genres. Additionally, video creation technologies like Sora, Runway, and Motion Diffusion are making it possible to produce short films or animations, demonstrating the expansive capabilities of AI in media production. These tools collectively illustrate the transformative impact of generative AI across multiple creative domains.
Generative AI differs from traditional AI systems in that it doesn’t just analyze and classify data but actively creates new, unique content based on the knowledge it has acquired.
1.1 The History of Generative AI
Generative AI is a type of technology that can create new things, just like humans can. It might be text, images, sounds, or even
videos. It’s a bit like having a very smart robot that can paint, write stories, or compose music!
1.1.1. The Early Years
The story of generative AI began a long time ago, in the 1950s and 1960s. It was like we were learning to build the first blocks that would later become a big castle.
In those days, scientists started creating the first “computer brains,” which we call neural networks. Imagine these networks are like spider webs made of tiny computers that learn to solve problems together.
In the 1980s, more advanced models were created, like genetic algorithms. This was a bit like teaching computers to copy the way plants and animals evolve in nature.
1.1.2. The 90s and 2000s
During this time, scientists invented new ways for computers to learn better from data. It’s like we gave computers big books full of information and taught them how to use them.
Probabilistic models were created then, such as Hidden Markov Models. This sounds complicated, but imagine it’s like a guessing game where the computer tries to predict what will happen next based on what it already knows.
Neural networks and unsupervised learning algorithms also developed during this time. It’s a bit like letting computers learn on their own, without constantly telling them what to do.
1.1.3. The Last Decade
In 2014, something really breakthrough happened - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were invented. Imagine we have two robots: one tries to create fake images, and the other tries to guess which images are real and which are fake. This way, both robots get better and better at their tasks.
More recently, transformer models like GPT-3 and DALL-E were created. These are like super intelligent machines that can write texts and create images almost as well as humans. They use huge amounts of data to learn how the world works and how we humans create different things.
All these inventions have led to today’s artificial intelligence that can do amazing things - write stories, paint pictures, and even compose music. It’s still not as good as real artists, but it’s getting better every year!
This history shows us how generative AI has grown from simple ideas to powerful tools that can create all sorts of things. It’s exciting to think about what it might be able to do in the future!
1.2. Key Algorithms and Techniques
In this chapter, we’ll learn about the special “recipes” that make generative AI work. These recipes are called algorithms, and
they’re like the secret ingredients that make AI so smart and creative.
1.2.1. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Imagine you have two robot friends: one is an artist, and the other is an art critic. The artist robot tries to create paintings that look real, while the critic robot tries to spot which paintings are fake. As they keep practicing, both robots get better at their jobs. The artist learns to make more realistic paintings, and the critic becomes better at spotting fakes.
This is how GANs work. They have two parts that compete with each other, helping both to improve. It’s like a fun game that makes the AI smarter and better at creating things that look real.
1.2.2. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
Think of VAEs like a magic box that can shrink things down and then make them big again. But it’s not just shrinking - it’s learning about the important parts of what it’s shrinking.
For example, if you put pictures of cats into this magic box, it learns what makes a cat look like a cat. Then, it can create new pictures of cats that it has never seen before! It’s like it understands the “idea” of a cat and can imagine new ones.
1.2.3. Transformer Models
Transformer models are like super smart readers. Imagine you have a friend who can read a whole library in a day and
remember everything! That’s kind of what transformer models do with information.
These models are really good at understanding language. They can write stories, answer questions, and even translate languages. It’s like they’ve learned how words work together to make sentences and stories.
One famous transformer model is called GPT (which stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer). It’s so good at writing that sometimes it’s hard to tell if a human or the AI wrote something!
1.2.4. Deep Convolutional Networks (DCNs)
DCNs are like the eyes of AI. They’re really good at looking at pictures and understanding what’s in them. Imagine you could look at a thousand pictures in a second and remember every detail - that’s what DCNs can do!
These networks are great for creating and changing images. They can take a picture of a dog and turn it into a painting, or they can create a completely new picture of a dog that doesn’t exist in real life.
All these algorithms work together to make generative AI so powerful. They help AI understand and create text, images, music, and even videos. It’s like giving a computer a paintbrush, a pen, and a musical instrument all at once!
By learning about these algorithms, we can understand how AI is able to be so creative. It’s not magic - it’s clever math and lots of practice with huge amounts of information. And who knows?
Maybe one day you’ll help create the next big algorithm that makes AI even smarter!
1.3 Practical Applications of Generative AI
Generative AI isn’t just something scientists talk about in labs. It’s being used in many exciting ways in the real world. Let’s explore some of these applications!
1.3.1 Art and Entertainment:
Generative AI is like a super creative artist that never gets tired. It can:
Create amazing pictures: Imagine telling a computer “Draw a cat riding a unicycle on Mars,” and it makes that picture for you!
Make music: AI can compose new songs in different styles. It’s like having a musician who knows every instrument and can play any type of music.
Help make movies: Some movies use AI to create special effects or even to help write scripts.
For example, there’s an AI called DALL-E that can draw anything you describe to it. People have used it to create funny, beautiful, and sometimes weird art that no one has ever seen before!
1.3.2 Medicine
AI is becoming a helpful assistant to doctors. It can:
Create fake patient data: This helps doctors practice without using real people’s information.
Design new medicines: AI can suggest new combinations of chemicals that might make good medicines.
Read X-rays and scans: Sometimes AI can spot things in medical images that even doctors might miss.
For instance, there’s an AI that helped design a new antibiotic to fight bacteria that other medicines couldn’t beat. It’s like having a super-smart scientist working non-stop to help keep people healthy!
1.3.3 Marketing and Advertising
AI is changing how companies tell people about their products:
Writing ads: AI can write many different versions of an ad to see which one people like best.
Creating images for ads: Just like with art, AI can make pictures for advertisements.
Personalizing ads: AI can help show different ads to different people based on what they like.
A company called Phrasee uses AI to write email subject lines that make people want to open the emails. It’s like having a friend who always knows the most interesting thing to say!
1.3.4 Games and Simulations
AI is making games more fun and helping people learn in new ways:
Creating game worlds: AI can help make huge game worlds filled with interesting things to explore.
Making characters in games smarter: AI can make the characters in games act more like real people.
Creating training simulations: These help people practice real jobs in a safe, computer-generated world.
For example, in a game called “No Man’s Sky,” AI creates entire planets for players to explore. Each planet is unique, with its own animals, plants, and landscapes. It’s like having a magic machine that can create endless new worlds!
1.3.5 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
This is all about AI understanding and using human language:
Chatbots: These are computer programs that can talk to people, answer questions, and help solve problems.
Translation: AI can help translate languages, making it easier for people from different countries to understand each other.
Summarizing text: AI can read long articles and write short summaries, like having a super-fast reader who can tell you the main points of any book in seconds.
A famous example is GPT-3, which can write stories, answer questions, and even help programmers write code. It’s like having a super-smart friend who knows a little bit about almost everything!
In all these areas, generative AI is helping people do things faster, create new and exciting things, and solve problems in ways we’ve never been able to before. It’s an exciting time to
learn about AI because new applications are being discovered all the time!
1.3.6 Sentiment Analysis
Generative AI is also really good at understanding how people feel about things. This is called sentiment analysis. It’s like having a friend who can always tell if you’re happy, sad, or angry just by listening to what you say!
Here are some ways generative AI helps with sentiment analysis:
Understanding emotions in text: AI can read reviews, social media posts, or emails and figure out if the person writing is feeling positive, negative, or neutral. Imagine having a magic pair of glasses that could show you the emotions behind every text message!
Helping businesses: Companies use this to understand what customers think about their products. It’s like having a super-fast assistant who can read thousands of customer comments and tell you what most people like or don’t like. This helps companies make their products better.
Improving customer service: AI can help identify upset customers quickly, so human helpers can step in to solve problems faster. It’s like having a special alarm that rings when someone needs extra help.
Analyzing social media trends: AI can look at millions of posts to see how people feel about current events or popular topics. It’s like having a magic thermometer that can measure the mood of the whole internet!
For example, during big events like elections or sports tournaments, AI can analyze tweets to see how people are
feeling. It’s much faster than humans trying to read all those messages!
Some cool real-world uses of sentiment analysis include:
Movie studios using it to predict how well a new film will do based on early reviews.
Politicians using it to understand how people feel about different issues.
Hotels using it to quickly spot and respond to negative reviews.
Sentiment analysis shows how AI doesn’t just understand the words we use, but can also pick up on the emotions behind them. This helps create better communication between people and machines, making our interactions with technology more natural and helpful.
It’s exciting to think about how this technology might be used in the future. One day, we’ll have AI assistants that can understand our moods and help cheer us up when we’re feeling down!
1.4 Challenges and the Future
While generative AI is exciting and powerful, it also faces some big challenges. Let’s explore these challenges and think about what the future might hold for this amazing technology.
1.4.1 Ethics and Copyright
One of the biggest questions about generative AI is: “Who owns what the AI creates?”
Imagine an AI writes a beautiful song. Who should get credit for it? The person who made the AI, the company that owns it, or should the AI itself get credit?
What if an AI creates a painting that looks very similar to a famous artist’s work? Is that okay, or is it copying?
These are tricky questions that lawyers and lawmakers are trying to figure out. It’s like when you play with your friends and create something together - sometimes it’s hard to say who came up with which idea!
1.4.2 Understanding and Interpretation
Another challenge is that we don’t always know how AI makes its decisions.
It’s like having a super-smart friend who always knows the answer, but can’t explain how they figured it out.
This can be a problem, especially in important areas like medicine or law, where we need to understand why decisions are made.
Scientists are working on making AI that can explain its thinking, kind of like a student showing their work in a math problem.
1.4.3 Bias and Fairness
AI learns from data, and sometimes that data can contain human biases.
For example, if an AI learns from books written a long time ago, it might think old-fashioned ideas are still true today.
This could lead to unfair treatment of certain groups of people.
It’s important to make sure AI is fair to everyone, just like we try to be fair when we play games with our friends.
1.4.4 Job Changes
As AI gets better at doing things, some jobs might change or disappear.
For instance, if AI can write news articles, what will happen to journalists?
But AI might also create new jobs we haven’t even thought of yet!
It’s a bit like when computers were first invented - some jobs went away, but many new and exciting jobs were created too.
1.4.5 The Future of Generative AI
Despite these challenges, the future of generative AI looks very exciting!
We might see AI that can create entire movies or video games based just on a story idea.
AI could help solve big problems like climate change by coming up with new ideas that humans haven’t thought of.
In education, AI could create personalized lessons for each student, helping everyone learn in the way that’s best for them.
Imagine having a super-smart, super-creative helper that can assist with almost anything. That’s what generative AI might be like in the future!
1.4.6 Working Together
The most important thing to remember is that AI is a tool to help humans, not replace them.
In the future, the best results will probably come from humans and AI working together.
Humans can provide creativity, emotional understanding, and ethical judgment that AI might struggle with.
It’s like having a super-powered paintbrush - it can help you create amazing art, but you’re still the artist making the decisions!
As we move forward, it’s important for everyone to learn about AI, understand its capabilities and limitations, and think about how we want to use this powerful technology. The future of generative AI is not just up to scientists and engineers - it’s up to all of us to decide how we want to shape this exciting new world!

Human-Written Text vs. AI
* * *
“The machine does not isolate man from the great problems of nature but plunges him more deeply into them.” - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
T
his chapter explores the evolving landscape of text creation, highlighting the interplay between human input and artificial intelligence. In the modern digital age, texts are rarely crafted by humans alone; instead, they are a product of both human effort and machine assistance.
Key points covered include:
Integration of AI in Writing: The chapter explains how AI tools, like Grammarly and other specialized solutions, have become essential in refining grammar, style, and overall quality of written content. This integration makes it challenging to distinguish between texts written solely by humans and those generated by AI.
Role of Large Language Models (LLMs): It discusses how LLMs, trained on extensive datasets of human-written texts, generate content that closely mimics human writing, blurring the lines between human and machine authorship.
Collaboration for Enhanced Productivity: AI tools are shown to assist writers by suggesting word choices, stylistic improvements, and even generating paragraphs, enhancing productivity and content quality across various fields, including marketing, academia, and technical writing.
Predictive Text Generation: The chapter highlights the benefits of predictive text generation, which speeds up writing by anticipating the next word or sentence, thereby reducing the cognitive load on writers.
Context-Aware Writing Assistants: AI’s ability to analyze tone, sentiment, and intent is discussed, illustrating how it can fine-tune content for specific purposes, such as making marketing copy more persuasive or technical documents clearer.
Challenges of Originality and Authenticity: The chapter raises important questions about the true authorship of AI-assisted content, emphasizing the need to balance AI’s capabilities with the preservation of human creativity and originality.
Ethical Implications: It addresses the ethical concerns associated with AI-generated content, such as the potential
for misuse and the importance of transparency and accountability to maintain trust in digital communication.
In conclusion, this chapter underscores the transformative impact of AI on text creation. While AI enhances efficiency and quality, it also challenges traditional notions of authorship and authenticity. As we embrace this new era, it is crucial to find a balance that leverages both human creativity and machine intelligence, fostering a collaborative future in digital writing.
* * *
In today’s digital age, where texts are crafted on computers, tablets, or even phones, the concept of a document entirely written by a human no longer exists.
Even if the initial input is manually typed, all elements of the post-process have become an integral and indispensable part of the content creation workflow. Every text produced on a computer undergoes checks by algorithms that correct typos and punctuation errors.
Marketing agencies now employ a whole array of tools to enhance grammar and style. These range from well-known resources like Grammarly to less familiar or specialized AI-based solutions and large language models (LLMs).
As a result, it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish between texts written by humans and those generated by AI. Additionally, as I mentioned in the previous chapter, texts written by generative algorithms are based on vast amounts of data, including huge collections of texts ever written and
digitized by humans. Such LLM systems typically generate what is most likely or similar to the texts they were trained on.
The data these models learn from are organic human texts. Therefore, an LLM that creates texts by mirroring the highest likelihood of resemblance to human-written texts sounds and appears as if it were written by a human.
This convergence of human and machine input in text creation has led to a new era in digital communication. The boundary between human creativity and machine efficiency is increasingly blurred. Writers and content creators are now collaborating with AI in ways that enhance productivity, accuracy, and creativity. AI tools can suggest word choices, provide stylistic recommendations, and even generate entire paragraphs based on the context provided by the human writer.
For instance, when drafting an article or an email, an AI tool might suggest alternative phrases that are more engaging or appropriate for the target audience. This not only saves time but also elevates the quality of the content. In academic writing, AI can help researchers by suggesting relevant sources, checking for plagiarism, and even formatting citations correctly. These tools have become essential in maintaining the high standards expected in professional and educational environments.
The integration of AI in writing extends beyond mere correction and suggestion. It includes predictive text generation, where the AI anticipates the next word or sentence a writer intends to type. This feature, widely used in smartphone keyboards and email applications, significantly speeds up the writing process
and reduces cognitive load on the writer. As a result, writers can focus more on the creative and conceptual aspects of their work.
Furthermore, AI-powered writing assistants are becoming more context-aware. They can analyze the tone, sentiment, and intent of the text, providing suggestions to match the desired style. For example, a marketing copy intended to be persuasive and engaging can be fine-tuned to enhance its impact, while a technical document can be adjusted for clarity and precision. This level of sophistication ensures that the content is not only grammatically correct but also contextually appropriate and effective.
However, this reliance on AI also raises questions about originality and authenticity. If AI is contributing significantly to the creation of content, who is the true author? This is particularly relevant in creative fields such as literature, journalism, and advertising, where the unique voice of the creator is highly valued. There is a growing need to balance the use of AI with the preservation of human creativity and originality.
Moreover, the ethical implications of AI-generated content cannot be ignored. The potential for misuse, such as generating deepfake text or manipulating information, poses significant challenges. Ensuring transparency and accountability in AI-assisted writing is crucial to maintaining trust and integrity in digital communication. As AI continues to evolve, it is essential to establish guidelines and standards that govern its use, ensuring that it complements rather than compromises human creativity.
In conclusion, the fusion of human and AI in text creation marks a transformative shift in how we write and communicate.
While AI enhances efficiency and quality, it also challenges our notions of authorship and authenticity. As we navigate this new landscape, it is imperative to strike a balance that leverages the strengths of both human creativity and machine intelligence, fostering a collaborative future in digital writing.

Can AI-Written Text Be Recognized?
* * *
“The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim.” - Edsger W. Dijkstra
I
n this intriguing chapter, we tackle a question that’s on the minds of many SEO professionals and content creators: Is it possible to distinguish between text written by humans and text generated by AI?
We begin by exploring the current state of AI-generated content
and how it has evolved to closely mimic human writing. You’ll discover why this question has become increasingly relevant and challenging to answer as AI technology advances.

Having read everything I’ve written so far, you might already have some thoughts on this question.
Like any innovation, when a new method of production emerges, we seek ways to distinguish between items made using old and new techniques. For example, this was the case when the first synthetic diamonds appeared on the market. Initially, there were effective methods to differentiate between synthetic and natural diamonds. However, as the technology for producing diamonds improved, synthetic diamonds became indistinguishable from real ones.
This led to two phenomena: first, a significant drop in the price of natural diamonds. Second, in response to their inability to create any reliable method to tell whether a diamond was natural or synthetic, producers of natural diamonds simply introduced certifications.
This approach might make sense for luxury products or items that convey prestige. But what about everyday items? Here, certification indicating that something is made in a traditional manner is largely irrelevant.
The same situation applies or has applied to texts and content generated by AI. Initially, AI-generated content was relatively easy to identify, and many tools were developed for this purpose. OpenAI once released such a tool. However, as
language models have been refined, prompts improved, and as people increasingly use auto-correction tools, style enhancers, and grammar editors like MS Word or Grammarly, it has become nearly impossible to distinguish AI-generated texts from human-written ones.
A telling example is when one of the most popular current tools for detecting AI-generated content was used to analyze a book of the Bible. The results were not only surprising but intriguing. As you might guess, the analysis suggested that the Bible was generated by AI.
Why is this finding so intriguing, and what does it tell us? It vividly illustrates a few points:
The basic principle of LLM models, as many explain in layman’s terms, involves choosing the most likely next words based on probabilities. These probabilities are learned from vast amounts of text written by humans. Thus, a well-trained model can produce text that sets words in a way that most likely resembles human writing. Therefore, there is no simple or reliable way to differentiate such text from that written by a human.
We’ve reached a stage where texts written by humans, or by humans with machine assistance, or even completely by machines using a good prompt and LLM, are indistinguishable.
So, this raises a critical question: If text written by a machine (an LLM model) is indistinguishable from text written by a human, what does this mean for internet search engines, for Google?
Does Google have its own methods for detecting AI-generated content?
Google itself has answered these questions. You can read
about it in the next section.

Google’s Stance on AI-Written Content
* * *
“The greatest danger in times of turbulence is not the turbulence; it is to act with yesterday’s logic.” - Peter Drucker
I
n this pivotal chapter, we delve into one of the most crucial aspects of using AI for SEO: Google’s official position on AI-generated content. As the dominant force in search, Google’s
stance significantly impacts how we approach AI in our SEO strategies.

For a while, it was unclear how Google viewed AI-generated text. There were various guesses and speculations.
Fortunately, Google decided to clear up any confusion and published their official position on their “Google Search Central Blog”.
At Google, we’ve long believed in the power of AI to transform the ability to deliver helpful information. In this post, we’ll share more about how AI-generated content fits into our long-standing approach to show helpful content to people on Search.
1
As explained, however content is produced, those seeking success in Google Search should be looking to produce original, high-quality, people-first content demonstrating qualities E-E-A-T.
In short: Google has no objections to AI-generated content as long as it doesn’t violate Google’s basic principles, is useful to
users (following the E-E-A-T guidelines), and isn’t created solely for illicit SEO manipulation.
4.1 What Google Officially Announced on Their Blog
Google has long believed in the power of AI to transform the way useful information is delivered. The company focuses on rewarding original, high-quality content that demonstrates the E-E-A-T traits: expertise, experience, authority, and trustworthiness. Google’s approach to content quality, regardless of how it’s produced, has been a guide for years in delivering reliable and high-quality results to users. Google has introduced a useful content system to ensure that content is created primarily for people, not just for search engine rankings.
Automatically generated content can be helpful, but its primary purpose should not be to manipulate search rankings, which violates Google’s anti-spam policy. Google has extensive experience in fighting spam, including through its SpamBrain system. However, automation can generate valuable content, such as sports results, weather forecasts, and transcripts. AI has the potential to enhance creativity and produce outstanding content, aligning with Google’s philosophy on leveraging new technologies.
For content creators, Google advises focusing on creating original, high-quality, people-oriented content that exhibits the E-E-A-T traits. Creators can learn more about the E-E-A-T concept on Google’s help page about creating useful and
trustworthy content. Evaluating your content in terms of “Who,” “How,” and “Why” will help maintain compliance with Google systems that reward valuable content. Google does not prohibit the use of AI in content creation, provided it is not used to manipulate search results.
4.2 Google E-E-A-T Guildines summary
Google’s guidelines for creating helpful, reliable, and people-first content emphasize the importance of producing high-quality, original information intended to benefit users rather than manipulate search engine rankings. Key points include:
Self-assessment
: Creators should evaluate their content for originality, depth, insightfulness, and overall quality. Consider external audits to understand the impact on search performance.
Content Quality
: Questions to ask include whether the content provides original research, substantial descriptions, insightful analysis, and value beyond simply copying other sources. The content should be well-produced, free of spelling or stylistic errors, and valuable compared to other search results.
Expertise
: Content should demonstrate expertise, be written by knowledgeable authors, and avoid factual errors. Trustworthiness can be enhanced by clear sourcing and author background.
Page Experience
: Google rewards content that offers a great user experience across various aspects, not just focusing on a few elements.
People-First Content
: Content should primarily serve an existing audience, demonstrate first-hand expertise, have a clear focus, and leave readers satisfied and well-informed.
Avoiding Search Engine-First Content
: Content created mainly to attract search engine visits, using automation excessively, summarizing others’ work without adding value, or focusing on trending topics without real expertise should be avoided.
SEO
: While SEO practices are important, they should be applied to enhance people-first content rather than focusing solely on search engine rankings.
E-E-A-T and Quality Rater Guidelines
: Content should demonstrate experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (E-E-A-T). Quality raters assess these aspects to help Google improve its ranking algorithms.
Evaluating “Who, How, and Why”
: Clearly indicate who created the content, explain how it was produced, and the reasons behind its creation to align with E-E-A-T principles. Transparency, especially regarding automation and AI usage, is encouraged.
By adhering to these guidelines, creators can ensure their content is valuable, trustworthy, and likely to perform well in Google Search results.

Understanding what Generative AI is, how it shapes content, and how it parallels—or doesn’t—with human-generated content, coupled with Google’s official stance on the matter, raises a crucial question: “How can I leverage Generative AI to my advantage?”
Before diving into this query, let’s ponder another:
Do I really need to use AI in SEO?
As history has shown, the advent of new technologies forces us to reconsider our approaches to existing problems and presents entirely new challenges.
This is no different in the case of the AI revolution. The rapid developments we are witnessing necessitate a fresh look at many aspects of content creation, SEO, and marketing in general.
Thanks to Generative AI, you can quickly and easily produce valuable content for your customers and users. This content can be based on your data, previous writings, or even integrated directly with your product database to generate content alongside new products, promotions, and sales.
The simplicity, accessibility, and low cost of creating content with Generative AI have led many companies and marketing agencies to adopt it on a large scale.
So, rest assured, if you’re hesitating, your competitors are likely already using it. Falling behind them is inevitable if you don’t start implementing it yourself.
Content created with the aid of Generative AI can be partially or fully automated, allowing for the production of a high volume of quality blog posts or social media updates. What do you think will happen if your competitors begin releasing one or two valuable posts daily while you continue to post sporadically, maybe once or twice a month?
The answer is straightforward; you’ll drop in Google search rankings. Perhaps you’ve already noticed this, or maybe it’s yet to come. But if you don’t take action, sooner or later, it will happen.
Is this certain?
Nothing in life is certain, but in this case, we have real data. Based on my experience with several companies where I’ve helped implement various technologies, I’ve observed firsthand how this actually works.
In every instance I’ve been involved with, we’ve seen a noticeable increase in Google’s indexing of pages and a corresponding rise in organic traffic from this search engine.
In some cases, the effect was almost immediate, especially if the website had strong existing metrics like core vitals, domain authority, etc., and faced less aware competitors. In other scenarios, especially with brand new sites, it took a bit longer. But yes, it always worked, regardless of whether the site was new or established. In every known case where it was implemented correctly, it simply worked.
Here, it’s crucial to emphasize
proper implementation
. It’s vitally important to either gain the necessary knowledge yourself
and do it right or to entrust it to a proven professional.
Inexperienced implementation can lead to results opposite to what is intended. A humorous yet enlightening example includes descriptions that once appeared on Amazon, where the absence of a critical review loop and inexperienced programming led to some unexpected results:
I am sorry but I cannot fulfill this request
Such blunders can be costly, which is why it’s important to rely on proven solutions and systems that self-check and verify. Unfortunately, even semi-automation and manual verification by people can fall short.

* * *
There is currently a plethora of tools on the market, catering to
nearly every kind of need.
I’d like to highlight a few categories of tools here. I’ll also share my recommendations for the tools I know and have used. Authors often try to avoid recommending specific products or naming companies, but I believe that providing concrete solutions only enhances the usefulness of this guide.
Of course, I always encourage you to do your own research and look beyond what I’ve listed here to find tools that best fit your needs. A useful resource for this is alternativeto.net, a site I often use, where you can explore alternatives to any tool I mention or have already discussed.
In this book, we examine AI tools and models specifically in terms of their application to SEO. For this reason, I’ve outlined two main types. First, there are base models, which are general-purpose tools or models. We can use these for working on our website’s SEO, but they’re not specifically designed for this purpose. Second, we have dedicated or integrated tools, which combine various models and systems specifically for SEO tasks.
6.1 Base Models
As I mentioned earlier, by “Base Models,” I mean general-purpose models (or tools). These are incredibly powerful tools with a wide range of applications, but they’re not specifically designed for SEO. Therefore, using them for SEO requires proper preparation and handling. They need appropriate
prompts and manual work, but they allow us to boost our SEO efforts.
With the right programming knowledge or by using no-code tools like n8n, Make, or Zapier, you can incorporate these base models into a larger workflow.
6.1.1 Text to Text Generators
Text to text generators are tools capable of producing text based on an input prompt. This input could be an instruction on what to write, our initial draft requesting refinement, a bulleted list of ideas meant to be developed into a longer and more engaging piece, or even a combination of different elements, including using an API to connect feeds of our products or services.
OpenAI GPT-4 / GPT-4o
The most well-known and popular generative AI with a WebChat interface is OpenAI. Importantly, OpenAI provides an API for its models, allowing for easy integration with other company systems and various automation types.
The API also offers access to additional parameters not available in the web interface, such as temperature control.
Antropic Claude 3.5 Sonet
As of writing this book, the current version is Claude 3.5 Sonet,
though newer versions are likely in the near future. However, for the sake of this guide’s practicality, I’m sticking to the currently available names. Despite being less popular than its counterpart at OpenAI, Claude 3.5 currently leads in generating text from text, producing better results.
Like GPT-4, it features both a webchat interface and an API.
LLama
An open-source solution from Meta (formerly Facebook), LLama is cheaper than its proprietary competitors but also the lowest in terms of output quality. Thanks to its open-source license, it can be used for free if you have the capability to host it on your own servers, or if you choose cloud hosting, you basically only pay for the hosting itself. It also provides a web interface and an API.
Mistral AI
Another open-source solution, and additionally non-commercial, unlike LLama from Meta. Mistral has no limitations regarding the number of queries or the size of the company using it. It can be completely free to use; you just need to host it yourself or in the cloud. It also comes equipped with a web interface and an API.
6.1.2 Text to Image
MidJurney
Midjourney is an AI program developed by Midjourney, Inc., based in San Francisco, that generates images from natural language descriptions. It is led by David Holz and uses Discord bot commands for user interaction. Launched in open beta on July 12, 2022, the platform has seen several updates with its latest version 6 released in December 2023. Midjourney is currently the most well-known text-to-image model due to the high quality of its generated images. It has been used for various purposes, including rapid artistic prototyping and advertising, but has also sparked controversies over its impact on artists and its moderation policies. Notably, it gained attention for a winning digital art piece and for generating viral images.
Dall-E OpenAi
DALL·E, developed by OpenAI, is a series of text-to-image models that generate digital images from natural language descriptions. The first version was released in January 2021, followed by DALL·E 2 in April 2022, and DALL·E 3 in October 2023, integrated into ChatGPT and Microsoft’s platforms. DALL·E models use deep learning to create images and have been used for various creative and practical applications. Despite their advanced capabilities, these models have faced ethical concerns regarding bias, potential misuse, and impact
on artistic jobs. OpenAI has also introduced watermarks and content filtering to address some of these issues.
Firefly Adobe
Adobe Firefly is a generative machine learning model integrated into Adobe Creative Cloud, currently in open beta. Developed using Adobe’s Sensei platform, Firefly is trained on a vast dataset including Creative Commons, Wikimedia, Flickr Commons, and Adobe Stock images. It generates designs and adjusts based on user feedback. First announced in September 2022 and released as a public beta in March 2023, Firefly is available to all Adobe Creative Cloud subscribers and has expanded its capabilities across various Adobe applications. Notably, Firefly for Enterprise was released on June 22, 2023.
Leonardo
Leonardo offers a range of fine-tuned models capable of generating a wide variety of content, including some designed for specific purposes.
For their premium users, they provide the ability to refine their own models using a small set of images (typically 10-20) directly on their platform. These models can replicate specific styles or types of content and assets. Additionally, users can share these customized models with others, fostering collaboration and innovation.
Stable Diffusion
Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image model developed by Stability AI and released in 2022. It uses deep learning diffusion techniques to generate detailed images from text prompts and is capable of inpainting, outpainting, and image-to-image translations. Developed with contributions from the CompVis Group at Ludwig Maximilian University and Runway, it is a publicly accessible model that can run on consumer hardware with a modest GPU. Unlike proprietary models like DALL-E and Midjourney, Stable Diffusion’s code and model weights are publicly available, making it widely accessible for various creative applications. It has undergone several iterations and enhancements, including the release of an XL version and the upcoming SD 3.0, which features a new architecture.
6.1.3 Text to …
This book focuses on SEO, so I won’t delve into other “Text To…” tools here. I will, however, mention that we now have access to tools like “text to speech” (elevenlabs), “text to video” (LumaLabs, OpenAI Sora, RunwayML), “text to music” (suno, udio), “text to vector,” and many others, and this list is constantly growing.
These are all fascinating tools with a wide range of applications, particularly in marketing, but this book narrows its focus to the specific aspect of marketing known as SEO. From an SEO
perspective, the most crucial “text to” tools are the two subtypes I’ve discussed in previous chapters.
6.2 Dedicated SEO Solutions
The tools I mentioned in chapters 6.1 could be considered base models or solutions. While these are powerful tools, in the context of SEO, they are just components that can be utilized in more intricate solutions.
Of course, we can create or commission more sophisticated SEO solutions. I’ve already listed most of the necessary tools, but we can also leverage existing solutions in the market that have done the job for us.
AI SEO Squad
2
This is a tool (or rather a toolkit, or as it’s called on the website, a team of AI agents) that I’ve used in practice, which I described in the next chapter. It’s one of the most advanced tools on the market that I’ve managed to find, allowing for full automation of SEO posts for our website and social media. Integrating this tool with our website systems requires some work, but everything is coordinated by the AISEOSquad team. In the next chapter, I’ll share both the approach we took in implementing this tool and the results we achieved.
Meow Wordpress AI SEO Tools
3
A very nice set of AI-based SEO tools dedicated to WordPress. It’s a great collection for all less advanced
WordPress users, as it easily provides everyone with the opportunity to leverage AI capabilities in SEO.
6.3 Other Non-SEO Tools worth mentioning
The tools listed here are not directly intended for SEO, but with the right prompts or methods, they can largely be applied to improve both your SEO and marketing efforts.
Megai
4
is an all-in-one AI platform that combines multiple AI models and tools, including ChatGPT, Claude AI, Google Gemini, and various image generation capabilities, into a single user-friendly interface. It offers features like custom personas, saved prompts, and workspace organization to enhance productivity for content creation, marketing, and various business tasks, all while providing flexible pricing plans to suit different user needs.

It offers features like AI-generated images, headlines, and competitor insights, making it a comprehensive tool for businesses of all sizes to create data-driven, results-focused advertising content quickly and efficiently.
Jasper
6
it stands out as a specialized AI-driven copywriting assistant designed for creating marketing content that aligns with a brand’s tone of voice. Using a mix of its proprietary model and GPT-3, Jasper helps generate various types of marketing
materials, from emails and ads to blog posts and sales listings. Its unique selling point is the ability to mirror a brand’s distinctive style, making it valuable for efficiently crafting brand-consistent content.
While Jasper was once at the forefront of AI-assisted copywriting, the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have somewhat diminished its edge. However, it can still be a helpful tool for marketers who don’t want to spend too much time fine-tuning their own prompts. In situations where quick, on-brand content is needed, Jasper continues to offer a streamlined solution that can save time and effort.
Quill Bot
7
is an AI-powered writing assistant that offers a suite of tools to help users improve their writing, including a paraphraser, grammar checker, plagiarism detector, and summarizer. It works across various platforms and integrates with popular browsers and apps, allowing users to enhance their writing wherever they go. With both free and premium options, QuillBot aims to help students, professionals, and content creators save time, boost creativity, and produce high-quality, polished writing in a fraction of the time it would typically take.

8
transforms note-taking with automated transcription and summarization of virtual meetings across multiple platforms, supporting over 69 languages. Featuring AI-driven search capabilities to sift through keywords and key discussions, along with options for annotation, sharing, and seamless integration with popular third-party apps, it becomes an invaluable tool for capturing and utilizing meeting insights efficiently.
Clara
9
is an advanced AI virtual assistant tailored for seamless meeting scheduling. By adding Clara to email threads via the
cc option, users can delegate the entire process of organizing meetings—from scheduling events to automated follow-ups. Clara personalizes interactions with a custom email signature and job title, managing meeting logistics in natural language. This reduces manual coordination efforts significantly. With features like automatic reminders and priority notifications, Clara enhances meeting management efficiency, making it indispensable for streamlined organization.
6.3.1 Customer Support Chat / Customer Information Chat
By this, I mean a webchat based on one of the models I mentioned (ideally) or on a custom model (which usually performs worse).
In the case of webchat, it’s beneficial to seek a solution tailored specifically to our industry. Overly generic solutions might result in a chat that provides not very useful information to users, thus deterring them from using it.
Drawing from my experience, at a company where I worked, we implemented an AI-based webchat, replacing live human operators. We had some concerns about how it would pan out, but it turned out to be a tremendous success.
The number of leads generated by the chat increased sixfold. This was likely due to the fact that, unlike human-operated chats that could take a minute or even several minutes to respond,
the AI chat replied within seconds. Previously, most customers probably gave up before getting any response.
Another important aspect was that the chat we chose was fully dedicated to our industry. It had been trained on the professional vocabulary and nuances of our field, honed to understand clients and their inquiries best. Additionally, as a standout feature, it could integrate with our product database (in our case, yacht listings) and suggest or search for the most suitable options for the client during the conversation.
The industry I implemented this chat for was Superyacht Sales and Luxury Yacht Charter. As you might guess, it’s a very demanding and quite specific field, yet the AI chat performed outstandingly well.
AI Yacht Chat
10
The chat we chose was AI Yacht Chat from Yachting.ai
I’ve seen many chat solutions that allow for quick retraining on a company’s data (via PDF upload). However, I would advise against such solutions as they might not be sufficiently trained for your industry.
If you want to significantly improve the quality of your chat, look for a solution tailored to your industry. For instance, if you’re in the automotive industry, look for a solution specifically for that industry. If it’s real estate, seek something dedicated to that field. Do not settle for generic solutions.
If you can’t find a solution tailored to your industry, try reaching out to the creators of the chatbot that best fits your needs and inquire about customizing it to match your specific requirements. It may initially cost more, but it will pay off in
the end. You’ll avoid many problems and frustrations for your clients/users.
Below is a list of AI chatbots for general use, which I generally advise against using. However, each of them has the capability of what I call ‘quick learning’. They can incorporate data from your company/industry as the foundational knowledge base for the chat. While not a fully dedicated solution that I strongly recommend, it’s not entirely generic either. At least it will be equipped with basic knowledge and terminology.
Nefi AI Chat
11
- This is a general chatbot that can be quickly trained on your knowledge base, whether it’s a PDF document, a website, or a text file. It’s a general chat from the company that I’ve used, adapted for my industry. What I like about it is its speed and lightweight nature, with minimal JS and CSS, making it highly optimized and importantly, won’t impact our website’s performance, which is crucial for SEO. The downside is, of course, that it’s a general-purpose chat.
Meow Chatbot
12
- Another general-purpose chatbot, which is its biggest drawback. The advantage of this solution is its easy integration with WordPress. It’s essentially a plugin for the entire SEO solution on WordPress. It also has the capability of ‘quick learning’ based on our company’s data.
InsertChat
13
- Yet another general-purpose chatbot solution with the ability for ‘quick learning’, meaning it can ingest documents specific to our industry/company right from the start.
ChatBase
14
- The last solution on my list. It’s another general-purpose chatbot quite popular in the market, offering the ability to input documents containing our company’s knowledge base.
6.3.2 Recommendation AI
This book focuses primarily on Generative AI, so I won’t be delving deeply into other AI models and solutions that can assist with SEO and overall usefulness of our websites.
However, I would like to briefly mention a particular subset of AI systems that recommend products to customers based on their profiles and the similarity of their choices to those of other customers.
Such AI solutions are known as Recommendation AI, and two major companies that offer them as an API are Amazon
15
and Google
16

Full Automation
* * *
“The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency.” - Bill Gates
I
n this chapter we’re diving into the exciting world of full automation in SEO using AI. This chapter is all about taking your AI-powered SEO to the next level, exploring how you can automate entire processes to save time and boost efficiency.
We’ll start by looking at what full automation means in the context of SEO and why it’s becoming increasingly important in
today’s fast-paced digital landscape. You’ll learn about different approaches to automation, whether you’re running a typical e-commerce site or a content-focused platform without a product feed.
We’ll explore real-world examples of successful automation strategies, including how to set up systems that can generate blog posts, create social media content, and even respond to industry news - all with minimal human intervention.
But don’t worry if this sounds complex! We’ll break down each process step-by-step, explaining how you can implement these strategies regardless of your technical background. We’ll also discuss the tools and platforms that can help you achieve full automation, and how to choose the right ones for your specific needs.
By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a clear understanding of how to leverage AI for full SEO automation, allowing you to scale your efforts and stay competitive in the ever-evolving digital marketplace. So, let’s get started and unlock the power of full automation in your SEO strategy!
* * *
As I mentioned in the chapter about Google’s stance on AI-generated content, it’s crucial to ensure that the content is:
• Valuable and useful to users
• Unique and specific
• Reliable and verified
Instead of just using individual tools for creating SEO content with AI, it’s worthwhile to take it a step further and apply comprehensive automation.
In a well-prepared workflow, AI-generated text is just one small component. Proper automation should at least incorporate these elements:
APIs for your products or services
Keywords and phrases important to you
Key landing pages on your website
Well-trained generative AI, tuned to the tone of your blog and brand
A resource database from your industry
7.1 Typical eCommerce
I’ll also share my experience here. The company I set up automation for, this time in the luxury watch industry, decided to use AI to automatically generate blog posts on their website and matching teasers for various social media platforms like Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google My Business.
They opted for a soution called WhiteCube.ai, named AI SEO Squad
17
. We had to properly adjust and train it, adding new connections like GMB, but everything eventually went smoothly, and within a week, we saw initial increases in organic traffic and rankings for some of our promoted keywords.
In this case, a significant role was played by the automation
we could implement because the store had its own product feed, which was continuously developed, regularly featuring new watches and jewelry. Based on this data, the AI SEO Team daily seeks relevant content from the product feed, such as sales but also new and interesting watches and other precious items, to create a tailored and keyword-enriched blog post. This blog post is then linked in the aforementioned social media.
It’s worth mentioning that we noted a significant impact on SEO particularly from links on LinkedIn.
This type of solution, which we successfully implemented, is ideal for eCommerce businesses that regularly introduce new products and have a large untapped potential for creating unique content.
Of course, the solution we applied, the AI SEO Team, is not the only one on the market. There are plenty of such applications available, but in our case, it was the easiest and quickest to use.
Tools like ContentGT allow for the automation of blog post creation, but the topics and entire workflow are up to us. If we have the time and skills, we can use tools like Make to perform such automation ourselves and prepare a list of topics (here, too, automation would be useful because the list can quickly run out). However, in the solution we chose, despite being more expensive, we avoided a whole host of problems, including preparing topics, connecting social media, setting up our CMS to fetch data from APIs, formatting this data, and automating
publication. Therefore, it’s important to remember all aspects when choosing an application.
7.2 No Product Feed
Of course, not every company or eCommerce operation has a product feed with constantly new records. Some businesses have a fixed assortment or simply offer services that don’t change significantly over time. They also don’t run promotions or sales often enough to base automation on them.
7.2.1 Topics Generated from Keywords
What can you do in such cases? There are several possible approaches. First, you can use tools like SEMRush or Ahrefs to generate and download a database of keywords crucial for your business. Then, using one of the Large Language Models (LLMs), you can prepare a list of blog post topics which could be automatically published using tools like ContentGT. However, this topic list will eventually run out, making this a semi-automatic solution.
To fully automate the process, you would need to use tools that can generate the aforementioned list and conduct internet research on your behalf. While there are many tools that generate texts based on a list of topics, such as ContentGT, Copy.ai, or Jasper.ai, and they provide the necessary APIs for automation, it’s challenging to find a solution that does all
the work for you, like the AI SEO Team from WhiteCube.ai mentioned earlier.
7.2.2 Blog Posts Based on Industry News
Another way to address the lack of a product feed is to utilize a news feed. This could be any paid news feed or even a free RSS News Feed from Google News, with necessary filters applied to ensure only industry-relevant news reaches us.
This is the approach I took in another company, where I helped automate content creation using Generative AI.
We tested several paid and free tools to source news, but ultimately, the Google RSS News Feed worked best for us.
In this case, to fully automate the process, we had to do most of the work ourselves. We didn’t have tools available that could do it quickly and efficiently for us.
The automation was accomplished using the aforementioned RSS Feed with appropriate filters and tools such as n8n, NoCodeDB, MidJourney, GPT-4, Claude, perplexity.ai, and, of course, VPS/Lambda.
The core of the automation is n8n, which fetches the list of news from the RSS feed at a set time each day. We then pass this list to GPT-4 to identify the most valuable news for us (we prepared specific prompts to let AI decide what should be published that day). It’s crucial to emphasize that this part must be executed very carefully and thoroughly tested. We certainly
don’t want blog posts on topics unrelated to our business suddenly appearing on our site.
After selecting the news topic, we employed another tool to perform internet research using perplexity.ai to gather as much credible and reliable information about the news as possible.
Here’s an important note:
Although Generative AI can write an article of any length on any topic you provide, you shouldn’t do this if you want to adhere to the earlier mentioned E-E-A-T standards.
Text-to-text generative AI is a tool where we can simply input a news topic we got from a Google News RSS feed, and in return, we get text that we can extend as much as we like by asking it to continue generating.
So, what’s stopping us from just doing that? Well, the issue lies in how LLMs and Generative AI operate in general. I’ve discussed how this works in the early chapters of this book. Given a topic, LLMs generate words that best fit thematically. By adjusting the temperature, we can control how creative the output will be.
However, the content it produces isn’t factual; it doesn’t provide actual information about the news. Instead of precise and factual information, it’s more akin to narrative text, barely related to the specific event or information. Not only does this not meet Google’s content quality standards, but it can also mislead your customers.
Therefore, instead of using LLMs to generate text based on a news title from an RSS feed, we perform online research. Using n8n and Python scripts, we’ve developed something like a web
spider that seeks out as many additional information sources on the topic as possible.
Typically, we gather about 5 to 10 extra sources. We collect all these texts and, using Claude, we compile them into one comprehensive piece, giving our blog post not only a broad but a thorough approach to the topic. This way, with the right prompts, the resulting blog post contains reliable information from various perspectives.
Of course, respecting copyright and the work of others (or bots), we provide links to the sources we used.
Such texts meet Google’s E-E-A-T requirements, are reliable and valuable for users. They often get condensed information on the topic and, moreover, a few extra links for further reading if they’re particularly interested. So, we’ve done the heavy lifting not only in extensively describing the topic but also in seeking more texts about it. It’s a win-win-win for the company I assisted with this implementation, the user, and SEO.
The next step was preparing a hero image for the blog post. What would a blog post be without an illustrative picture? People are visual, and even if they visit the blog to read its content, they won’t click if it’s not illustrated by an appropriate image.
Here again, one might wonder why not just use an image from the RSS feed we get from Google. And once again, I strongly advise against this approach, as it could get you into a lot of trouble.
Images and photos used in news posts are the property of the services that publish them. They have either purchased them or
created them, and they own the intellectual property rights to use them.
Therefore, copying these images would not only be unethical but also violate copyright laws and could expose you (or the company I helped set up the automation for) to financial and reputational damage.
Always respect intellectual property rights when preparing or developing automations.
To avoid all these issues, we decided to create our own images. As you probably know, there are many tools available for this. Initially, we planned to use Dall-E, but the quality of the generated photos and images wasn’t good enough for us.
Another popular solution is Leonardo.ai. It’s a very good tool and I definitely recommend it for such applications, but we decided to use MidJourney instead.
Without getting into the technical aspects, the whole automation process looks like this:
n8n activates at a set time and reads the RSS Feed from Google News.
It passes the news to GPT-4, which selects the most relevant topic.
The selected topic is then passed to a bot, which uses perplexity to search for more information about it and gather sources.
The gathered information is passed to Claude, which uses it to write an article.
GPT-4 creates a prompt based on the written article to generate an image.
The prompt is sent to MidJourney, which generates the image.
All this data is sent to the company’s CMS API, which I helped automate, and shortly after, a blog post is created, complete with a hero image, valuable text, and reference links.
This process runs so smoothly and yields such good results that I often find myself reaching for information from the posts it generates (the topics happen to interest me).
We didn’t have to wait long for Google to notice these posts. Although the content isn’t as unique as when it’s generated based on a product feed, the use of multiple sources and a thorough approach still makes it valuable enough and written differently enough that Google started appreciating it and directing some traffic our way.
After about 2-3 months, we noticed that the blog posts generated in this way were being visited by users who found them directly on Google.
7.1.2 Newsletter Approach
Another possible approach to automation is the use of one or several industry newsletters.
For this, it’s advisable to set up a new email account, where we can subscribe to a few selected newsletters that cover topics relevant to our industry.
Then, we prepare automation similar to the one I described in the previous chapter. However, instead of using an RSS
News Feed, we utilize the content from these newsletters. Just like before, we employ a GPT-4 type LLM to identify the most interesting and important topics from the newsletters we receive, which we then explore further through online research.
The rest of the automation process remains the same.
7.3 Practical Sentiment Analysis with Generative AI
Welcome to the exciting world of practical sentiment analysis using generative AI! In this section, we’ll dive into the nitty-gritty of how to actually use AI to understand the emotions and opinions hidden in text.
Sentiment analysis is like teaching a computer to be an emotion detective. It’s a powerful tool that can help businesses, researchers, and even everyday people understand how others feel about various topics. With generative AI, we can take this a step further, creating more flexible and powerful sentiment analysis tools.
In this chapter, we’ll explore:
How to create effective prompts for sentiment analysis
The difference between k-shot and zero-shot learning in sentiment analysis
Techniques for providing examples to improve AI performance
An introduction to prompt engineering specifically for sentiment analysis
Whether you’re a business owner wanting to understand
customer feedback, a researcher studying public opinion, or just someone curious about AI, this chapter will give you practical skills to start using generative AI for sentiment analysis.
Get ready to unlock the power of AI to read between the lines and understand the emotions behind the words!
This introduction sets the stage for a detailed discussion on prompt engineering, k-shot and zero-shot learning, and providing examples in the context of sentiment analysis. You can now proceed to write the detailed content for each of these topics within this section.
* * *
When dealing with full-scale automation, especially where dozens of blog posts and social media updates are published daily across various platforms, it’s crucial to keep everything in check.
One way to monitor and maintain high quality is by using autonomous content critic agents, as mentioned in previous chapters. These ‘content critics’ ensure the quality of our AI-generated content. If implemented correctly, this should be enough to keep things running smoothly.
But let’s raise the bar and introduce another mechanism to boost the quality of our automation.
When posting on social media, we often have the option to disable comments. While this is one solution, it’s not ideal.
Social media thrives on interaction and user comments. These interactions improve post visibility and reach. So, blocking comments isn’t always the best approach.
However, if we leave comments open, we risk facing problems where users might negatively or unpleasantly react to our brand or product. With a high volume of posts, manually checking comments daily becomes an impossible task.
This is where Generative AI can come to our rescue. Fortunately, there are methods to use it for sentiment analysis. We can easily leverage this to collect all new comments from our social media channels daily and filter them through our generative AI to weed out those with negative sentiment. These comments can be compiled into daily reports, allowing us to take appropriate action.
7.3.1 How to Adapt Generative AI for Sentiment Detection
The best approach is to use the k-shot method combined with skillful prompt engineering. Here’s a practical example below:
This is a text message sentiment classifier
Message: "I can't stand waiting in long lines at the grocery store"
Sentiment: Negative
Message: "Today's weather ruined my plans for a picnic."
Sentiment: Negative
Message: "I'm escatic about the upcoming vacation to
Hawaii"
Sentiment: Positive
Message: "Attending the concert last night was a blast!"
Sentiment: Positive
Message: "Finding a parking spot in the city is always a hassle."
Sentiment: Negative
Message: "The sunrise this morning was breathtaking"
Sentiment: Positive
Message: "Dealing with rush hour traffic is frustrating."
Sentiment: Negative
Message: "Receiving flowers unexpectedly made my day"
Sentimet: Positive
Message: "Getting a flat tire on the way to work was so inconvinient."
Sentiment: Negative
Message: "Learning a new language has been challenging but rewarding."
Sentiment:
Copy
LLM response:
Positive
Copy
Using this method gives us a much higher guarantee that the LLM model will accurately recognize the sentiment of the
queries we feed it.
The prompt for sentiment recognition can be modified. Instead of using a single message for recognition, you can provide a list of, say, 10 consecutive messages, and the model should recognize them just as well.
Current models are advanced enough that you can also try a zero-shot approach, which means not providing those 10 examples of sentiment recognition. This should work in some cases.
However, when we want to fully automate and use this tool on an almost mass scale, it won’t be enough for us to have just some cases where it works correctly. We’ll want to aim for most, if not all, cases to be correctly recognized. That’s exactly what the k-shot method is for. It significantly improves the quality of results and model performance.
In full automation, sentiment recognition is a crucial factor.
Imagine a situation where you’ve implemented full automation. In a well-executed automation of your SEO content, using the methods or tools I described in the previous chapter, content will appear on your website without your intervention. Completely autonomous AI programs will do all the work for you.
If you want to get the most out of SEO, you’ll also integrate your blog with automatic social media posts (as I described).
Since social media is the point of contact between your company and direct user interactions, it’s possible that someone might
dislike your content, or someone might just enjoy hating on your products, or maybe your competition is playing dirty.
Regardless of the reason, it’s worth protecting yourself against such problems and damage to your company’s or personal image.
The ideal solution here would be automation using a single AI agent, prepared to analyze the sentiment of comments under your posts. To do this, you can create a prompt similar to the one I presented here, use it as one of the input parameters for your chosen LLM model, and using tools like N8N, Make, or Zapier, or simply a Python script, prepare a cyclically running automation that will read posts appearing on your social media. Such automation should check new posts daily, examine their sentiment, and record it in a register. You should then prepare weekly and monthly reports showing you the sentiment of your followers.
It’s also worth preparing a separate agent to monitor anomalies. This means you’ll present it with a “normal” situation using the k-shot method I described, and you’ll show it daily reports from the sentiment-analyzing agent so it can recognize anomalies. Such anomalies, whether an unusual increase in positive or negative sentiment, should be reported to you immediately.

Things to Watch Out For

elcome to Chapter 8, where we’ll explore the potential pitfalls and challenges of using AI in SEO. While AI offers exciting opportunities, it’s important to be aware of the risks and how to avoid them.
In this chapter, we’ll discuss common mistakes and issues that can arise when implementing AI in your SEO strategy. We’ll
cover important topics like copyright concerns, the risks of over-relying on AI-generated content, and how to maintain quality and originality in your work.
We’ll also look at some real-world examples of AI implementations gone wrong and learn from these experiences. You’ll discover practical tips on how to set up safeguards and checks in your AI processes to prevent errors and ensure your content remains valuable and compliant with search engine guidelines.
Additionally, we’ll peek into the future of AI in SEO, discussing emerging trends and best practices that will help you stay ahead of the curve. By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a clear understanding of the potential challenges and how to navigate them effectively.
So, let’s dive in and learn how to use AI in SEO responsibly and effectively, avoiding the common pitfalls that could hinder your success!
* * *
8.1 Copyright laws
As I previously discussed in the section about my real-world implementations, it’s crucial to be vigilant about copyright laws.
This is especially true for any images, photos, and other visual
elements. It’s best to avoid using images from other websites unless they’re from stock photo services that offer royalty-free rights. Instead, consider using generative AI to create the necessary images.
This is important whether you’re creating content for personal use, your company, or a client. If it turns out that an image is copyrighted and we’ve used it in an automatically generated blog post, at best, we’ll simply have to remove it, losing an eye-catching hero image and wasting time for any posts that featured it. At worst, we might face a fine or legal action.
Moreover, this could lead to reputation damage, especially if we implemented it for a client. Thus, respecting copyright is not only ethically right but also keeps various troubles at bay.
8.2 Critique Agent and the Infinite Loop Issue
Another point of caution is over-reliance on large language models (LLMs). As I’ve mentioned in previous sections, improper input data or poorly crafted prompts can lead to nonsensical text output. One way to prevent this is to use a system of agents and loop them in the text generation process. You could add an LLM agent whose role would be to critique text generated by another LLM or a different prompt.
The goal of this looped process is to ensure that the resulting text doesn’t contain any nonsense and is appropriate to the content and tone we’ve chosen.
However, this introduces another risk: the infinite loop.
Generative AI, especially LLMs, are designed to provide a response each time they are prompted. If the critic isn’t carefully set up to check if the content is correct and to make adjustments only when necessary, it might endlessly make changes. Therefore, this requires careful attention because such automation could not only fail to conclude but also result in substantial costs. This could be a costly mistake, particularly if token limits in the LLM are set relatively high.
8.3 The inadequacy of images - Adding Vision Model
A recent real-life example of issues to watch out for is matching images to blog or social media posts. This is especially important when we’re not generating the images ourselves but using them from a Product Feed API.
In our early implementations, we sometimes ran into situations where the image didn’t match the description, which created a really unpleasant overall effect.
We solved this by adding another model and validator to our workflow. Alongside our LLM models, we decided to use a Vision model that analyzed images intended for social media posts or as hero images in blog posts. By recognizing what’s in the image, the model could generate relevant text, which we then refined using LLM models.
This approach helped us avoid problems that can occur when an article based on a product feed covers multiple products.
8.4 Future Outlook and Best Practices
As AI technology evolves, so too must the strategies for its implementation. Staying updated with the latest advancements and regulatory changes is crucial. Businesses should invest in training for their teams not only on how to use these tools effectively but also on understanding their limitations.
Best practices would include establishing a clear AI usage policy, regularly reviewing and updating AI systems in line with technological advancements, and maintaining an ethical approach to AI use. Encouraging openness about the use of AI in creative processes and setting realistic expectations about the outcomes will also play a critical role in integrating these technologies into business operations smoothly and ethically.
By carefully managing these aspects, companies can harness the full potential of AI to enhance their operations while avoiding the pitfalls that come with technology adoption. This balanced approach will be essential as businesses navigate the increasingly digital and AI-driven landscape.

We’ll recap the crucial points about using AI in SEO, highlight the importance of staying up-to-date in this fast-changing field, and offer some practical advice on how to keep your AI-powered
SEO strategy on track. We’ll also touch on the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in the world of digital marketing.
Whether you’re just starting out with AI in SEO or you’re looking to refine your existing strategy, this chapter will provide you with a clear set of guidelines to keep in mind. We’ll break down complex ideas into simple, actionable steps that you can apply to your own projects.
By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a solid understanding of the key principles that will help you navigate the exciting world of AI-powered SEO. So, let’s dive in and cement those crucial points that will set you up for success in your digital marketing journey!
Remember that technology, especially the latest advancements, is constantly evolving. AI develops rapidly and changes frequently. Every day, new tools and opportunities emerge.
* * *
To stay updated with SEO, it’s essential to continually seek new information and check the latest recommendations from search engines.
In cases of full automation, it’s also important to periodically verify their operations. You can even set up automations to periodically check all newly created blog posts and report the
weakest ones or send alerts when something inappropriate is detected.
In conclusion, I encourage ongoing monitoring and staying informed, as the fields of Generative AI and SEO are incredibly fast-changing.
Expanding on the topic, it’s important to highlight the role of continuous learning and adaptation in the technology and SEO sectors. As new algorithms emerge and consumer behavior shifts, staying competitive means staying informed. For instance, Google often updates its search algorithms, which can dramatically affect SEO strategies. Professionals need to adapt quickly to maintain or improve their search engine rankings. This can involve learning new tools or techniques, participating in industry forums, and attending relevant workshops or conferences.
Moreover, the integration of AI into SEO and other areas of digital marketing is no longer a novelty—it’s a necessity. AI can analyze data at a scale that’s impossible for humans, providing insights that can enhance decision-making processes and optimize marketing strategies. For example, AI can help identify emerging trends or predict changes in consumer behavior, allowing marketers to tailor their strategies more effectively. However, this also means that professionals need to be proficient not only in their core marketing skills but also in understanding and leveraging AI technologies.
Finally, ethical considerations and best practices in using AI and automation in digital marketing cannot be overlooked. As technology becomes more capable of making decisions, ensuring these decisions are fair and do not perpetuate biases is crucial. Transparency in how AI is used, the data it analyzes, and the decisions it influences is essential to maintain trust and comply
with regulatory standards. Staying informed about these aspects is just as important as keeping up with technical updates, ensuring that professionals use AI responsibly and effectively in their strategies.
